# Project Brief

This project is a real-time voice chat demo app built with Next.js, React, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. It uses OpenAI's Whisper API for real-time streaming transcription and OpenAI GPT-4o for chat completions. The app features robust silence detection, accessible and modern UI, and supports both light and dark mode. All Gemini-specific code has been removed in favor of OpenAI APIs.

## Core Requirements and Goals

- Real-time voice-to-text transcription using OpenAI Whisper
- Real-time AI chat responses using OpenAI GPT-4o
- Streaming UI for both transcription and chat
- Robust silence detection and error handling
- Accessible, visually polished, and dark mode support
- No Gemini API dependencies
