# Project Brief

Build a React-based frontend (Next.js) that enables real-time voice chat with the Gemini Voice API. The app should capture user voice, stream it to Gemini, and display the AI's responses as text in dynamically updating speech bubbles. The UI must use shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS. Maintain a clear conversation history and provide a polished, accessible user experience.
