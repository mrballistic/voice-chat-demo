# Progress

**What works:**
- Real-time voice capture and silence detection
- Transcription via OpenAI Whisper API
- Streaming chat completions via OpenAI GPT-4o (NDJSON, real-time UI updates)
- Node.js WebSocket proxy for OpenAI realtime voice-to-voice API (local/dev)
- Proxy relays AI audio as binary to frontend, all other messages as JSON
- Frontend streams PCM16 audio to proxy, plays back AI-generated audio in real time
- Modern, accessible UI with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode and error handling

**What's left:**
- Further UI/UX polish and accessibility
- Advanced error handling and user feedback
- (Optional) Add OpenAI TTS/voice streaming for AI replies (legacy REST)
- Document known limitations and edge cases

**Known issues:**
- Some edge cases in audio streaming/playback may need further handling
- All Gemini/Google code removed; all OpenAI endpoints are functional
