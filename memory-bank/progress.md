# Progress

**What Works:**  
- Next.js project scaffolded with shadcn/ui and Tailwind.
- Chat UI and message streaming logic in place.
- Gemini API utility functional for text prompts.

**What's Left:**  
- Full voice recording and speech-to-text pipeline.
- Real-time streaming of user voice to Gemini.
- UI/UX polish, accessibility, and error handling.

**Known Issues:**  
- Voice input is simulated, not live.
- Speech-to-text integration is pending.
- Streaming may need optimization for latency.
