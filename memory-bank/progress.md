# Progress

**What works:**
- Real-time voice capture and silence detection
- Transcription via OpenAI Whisper API
- Streaming chat completions via OpenAI GPT-4o (NDJSON, real-time UI updates)
- Node.js WebSocket proxy for OpenAI realtime voice-to-voice API (local/dev)
- Modern, accessible UI with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode and error handling

**What's left:**
- Implement frontend WebSocket client for real-time audio streaming and playback
- Integrate microphone capture and AI voice playback
- (Optional) Add OpenAI TTS/voice streaming for AI replies (legacy REST)
- Further UI/UX polish and accessibility
- Advanced error handling and user feedback

**Known issues:**
- No Gemini/Google code remains; all OpenAI endpoints are functional
